# üìö Python Library Management System (LMS)
This project is a functional, menu-driven Library Management System developed using Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm. It simulates the essential operations of a small library, providing a practical demonstration of Python classes, methods, file handling, and basic data structures.

## ‚ú® Features

The application provides a main menu interface and supports the following functionalities:

* **Display Books [D]:** View a list of all books in the library, including their unique **Book ID**, **Title**, and current **Status** (available or issued).
* **Issue Book [I]:** Allow a user to borrow a book. It records the borrower's name, the issue date, and updates the book's status to 'already issued'.
* **Return Book [R]:** Allow a user to return a borrowed book. It clears the lender details and updates the book's status back to 'available'.
* **Add Book [A]:** Enable a staff member to add a new book title to the library's collection and database.
* **Quit [Q]:** Exit the application.

 ## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
* **Core Concepts:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), File Handling (`.txt` files), Dictionaries (for in-memory data structure), and the `datetime` module.

## üìö What I Learned
* Class Design: Mastered the creation and utilization of a single, comprehensive LMS class to manage all system data and functionality, adhering to the principle of encapsulation.
* Flat-File Database: Implemented a simple form of data persistence by using a plain .txt file (list_of_books.txt) to store book titles, simulating a basic database connection.
* Menu-Driven Interface: Developed a robust, looping command-line interface (CLI) to guide the user and handle user input, including making the input case-insensitive.
* Code Documentation: Practiced writing Docstrings for the class and methods to clearly explain their purpose, arguments, and return values.
